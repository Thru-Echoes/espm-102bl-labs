# Natural Resource Sampling (ESPM 102b)

Hello - here are notes, hints, references, etc for *UC Berkeley fall 2018 ESPM 102b: Natural Resource Sampling.*

**Note: Midterm 2 is a take-home.** Handed out in class *30 Oct* and due in physical form *2 Nov*.

*The exam will cover stratified random sampling and ratio sampling.*

## 1. Note on linear regression

I want to offer feedback on interpreting linear regression in hopes that it will help: 

#### Assumptions

Remember, when you are applying linear regression on data you are assuming a bunch of things about the data. E.g. normality, homoscedasticity, no autocorrelation, etc. And linear regression is very sensitive to outliers. 

#### Question the model

Does the point all the way to the right follow the same trend as the others? What would happen to the trendline if that data point was removed?

#### Case: Tree height vs DBH from lab 1

To prove my points above: 

I created a polynomial (non-linear) "trend of best fit" of order 6 and has an R^2 value of 0.69. Linear regression has an R^2 value of 0.64. Thus, a non-linear model out-performs the linear regression model. So a non-linear and curved trend is a better fit for this relationship (i.e. height of trees and diameter).

## 2. Stratified Random Sampling

There are three stratum considerations when picking one of the four allocation approaches. Those considerations are:

i) Size of the stratum (spatial consideration)
ii) Variance in the stratum
iii) Cost of sampling across stratum

**Know these considerations and how they apply to each method!**

## 4. Misc

By popular demand, here is a [link to a 7-song album (and another 5-song album)](https://ahburrmolercaine.bandcamp.com/album/development) that I wrote, performed, recorded, and produced back when I was an undergrad in 2011.
