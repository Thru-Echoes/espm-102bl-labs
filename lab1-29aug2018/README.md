## Confidence Interval 

Confidence Intervals (CI) contain lower and upper bounds. They are calculated with the mean and the function <code>=confidence.t(alpha, standard_dev, size)</code>.

### Example usage

```
alpha = 0.05 (5% significance level)
standard_deviation = 1
sample_size = 50
=confidence.t(0.05, 1, 50)
```

## Misc Tips

- you can prevent Excel from evaluating a function that is incomplete by typing <code>'=incomplete.formala</code>

- you can go into **Formula Builder** to breakdown complex / nested functions and step through
